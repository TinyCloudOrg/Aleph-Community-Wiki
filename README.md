# Community Wiki Tool

## Description
The Community Wiki Tool is an innovative solution designed to transform unstructured information into organized, explorable knowledge. It processes data from various sources such as Telegram or Slack chats, meeting transcriptions, and other unstructured inputs. The tool leverages AutoGraph, an AI-powered knowledge graph generator, to create structured, interconnected information that can be easily digested and explored.

## Key Features
- Processes large volumes of unstructured data
- Infers structures and connections between higher-level concepts
- Organizes information into a usable, explorable format
- Creates an idea web or wiki from processed data
- Connects related ideas and paradigms
- Attributes notes to specific individuals or topics
- Generates a digestible summary of processed information
- Outputs processed information into a larger wiki structure

## Technologies Used
- AutoGraph: An AI-powered knowledge graph generator that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) pipeline for data sorting and structuring

## Usage
*[This section is currently under development]*

## How It Works
1. Input: The tool takes in unstructured information from various sources (e.g., chat logs, transcripts)
2. Processing: AutoGraph analyzes the input and generates a knowledge graph
3. Output: The tool produces:
   - A structured knowledge graph
   - A digest of the processed information
   - An option to output the processed information into a larger wiki

## Current Status
This project is currently in development. Installation instructions and usage guidelines will be provided as the project progresses.
