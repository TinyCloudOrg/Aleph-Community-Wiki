# Aleph Community Wiki

A wiki and knowledge graph capturing the ongoings of [Aleph, Cuidad de Crecimiento](https://aleph.crecimiento.build/).
## Overview

The Aleph Community Wiki is a community tool that captures the ongoings at Aleph, powered by the participants at Aleph. Activities in the telegram chat and uploads by users are turned into Wiki articles, connected to other articles, and used to update the connected content.

The content captured allows the ephemeral happenings at Aleph to be distilled into a digital artifact that can be used by it's participants, power other applications, and be a repository of concepts for future events.
## How it works

1. Content is captured by Aleph Participants and added to the [Aleph Wiki Upload Tool](https://aleph-uploader.communitywiki.ai/)
2. Content uploaded is added to the knowledge graph and published on a recurring basis.
3. Data updates are handled via the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TinyCloudOrg/Aleph-Community-Wiki). Pulling down this repo also allows the graph to be explored and edited via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 
## Information Sources
- Telegram
- Recordings via [Aleph Wiki Upload Tool](https://aleph-uploader.communitywiki.ai/)
