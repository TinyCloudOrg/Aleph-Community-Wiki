### About Me
Hello, this is UlaÅŸ. I came from Istanbul with my colleague [[Aalim Sahin]] to attend the Aleph event.

### What I Do
We are building [[Clava]], a self-custodial mobile wallet on [[zkSync]]. Our aim is to transform on-chain UX and security practices.

### Always Down For
- Exploring the crypto scene in Argentina and Latin America.
- Understanding various use-cases, habits, and needs within the crypto community.

### Connect With Me
Feel free to visit us at the [[Aleph Hub]] if you would like to chat about Clava, potential collaborations, crypto in Argentina, or any other topic. ðŸ§‰ðŸŒž
