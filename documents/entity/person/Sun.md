## Sun

### About Me
Sun is originally from [[China]] and made his first visit to Argentina during the [[muBuenos]] event. He has since developed a deep connection with the country, making numerous friends and falling in love with Argentina.

### What I Do
Sun is a key member of the core team at [[Aleph]] and [[Crecimiento]]. He focuses on funding and week 2 crypto use cases. He also works with [[Manon]], [[Santi]], and Vee as part of the [[the mu]] team. Sun is hopeful about possibly acquiring Argentine citizenship through his involvement in building Aleph, though he mentions this in a lighthearted, joking manner.

### Always Down For
- Discussing business ventures
- Outdoor activities like "touching the grass" and enjoying an asado (Argentinian barbecue)

### Projects and Interests
Sun is committed to supporting the long-term movement of Aleph and [[Crecimiento]]. He is involved in the creation of an African version of Crecimiento, inviting interested parties to collaborate.
