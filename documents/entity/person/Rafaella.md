### About Me
Hi everyone! I'm Rafaella, also known as Babi. Originally from [[São Paulo]], Brazil, I am now living in Montevideo. I've been deeply involved in the DeFi space since its early days and have developed several DeFi protocols, including options, an option-specific AMM, and structured products.

### What I Do
I co-founded [[pods.finance]] and am currently exploring new challenges within DeFi and crypto, focusing on B2B demands in Brazil. I believe in the efficiency brought by smart contracts to financial products and their potential to significantly accelerate humanity's progress.

### Interests
I'm very enthusiastic about financial products and their applications, especially within the context of DeFi. I also enjoy comparing different neighborhoods, recently having discovered that Palermo is 100 times better than Pinheiros and Soho.
