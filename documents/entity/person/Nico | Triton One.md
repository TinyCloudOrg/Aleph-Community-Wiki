## Nico | Triton One

### About Me
I'm Nico, originally from [[Buenos Aires]]. I'm 30 years old and I have one child. Currently, I live in Vicente LÃ³pez. Ever since I was a child, I've been fascinated with crypto and computers. Notably, I started mining Bitcoin using a GPU back in 2011, and I regretfully sold those early mined Bitcoins for a few dollars. If only I had held onto them, I could have owned an island by now!

### Professional Background
I work as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at [[Triton One]], an organization that is native to the [[Solana]] ecosystem. Triton One is renowned as one of the major RPC providers for Solana and other blockchain networks.

### Areas of Interest
- **Always Down For**: 
  - Enjoying good food and wine
  - Exploring top-notch bars in Buenos Aires (the city boasts 3 of the top 50 bars in the world ðŸ‘€)

### Contact and Collaboration
If you are developing something on [[Solana]], I am eager to discuss how we at Triton One can support your initial steps. Letâ€™s collaborate!
