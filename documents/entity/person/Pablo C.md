I’m [[Pablo C|Pablo Cabona]], from Argentina and moving to Spain next year. I am passionate about filming, flying drones, and watching my football team. Those looking for me will find me at the Amalfitani Stadium, watching matches. You'll be able to spot me easily as I’m the one who’s two meters tall.

### What I Do
