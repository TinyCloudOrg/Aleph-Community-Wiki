# Bequita

Hola! Iâ€™m Rebeca (or Bequi). I'm from the best country in the world, Argentina. Although now I live in [[CABA]], I lived most of my life in Alejandro Korn, a small town in the south side, far far away from the city.

## About Me

### Background
I study academic arts (oil painting and drawing) and Solidity. The last three years I have worked as a software developer in web2, but got tired of it and decided it was time to make a change and go back to what once got all my attention, which is web3 tech. Right now Iâ€™m starting a project that connects the world of Tango (which is so old-fashioned) and web3.

### Interests
- **Hobbies and Passions:** I would like to paint someone/a scene during [[Aleph]]! If anyone wants to join and paint or pose that would be great. I also dance Tango ðŸ’ƒ and sing. 
- **Always Down For:** Doing anything related to crypto/art, talking, eating, drinking tea, and doing calisthenics.

### Engagement
Iâ€™m looking to be involved in web3 technology through my new project that integrates old-fashioned Tango and modern blockchain technology.

## Connections
If there are any other artists and dancers, I would love to connect and collaborate.
