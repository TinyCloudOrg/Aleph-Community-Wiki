## Overview

**API3 DAO** is an organization dedicated to the creation and development of decentralized APIs (dAPIs). The primary goal is to connect traditional APIs to smart contracts, striving to eliminate third-party intermediaries and enhance the trust and security of data feeds.

## Goals and Vision

- **Decentralization**: API3 aims to build a fully decentralized network for APIs.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Focus on integrating APIs directly with smart contracts to enhance functionality and security.
- **Trustless Systems**: Develop systems that do not rely on third-party intermediaries, ensuring trustworthiness and direct access to data.

## Activities and Projects

- **dAPI Development**: Actively involved in the development and deployment of decentralized APIs.
- **Community Engagement**: The organization embraces community feedback and contribution through its DAO structure.
- **Collaborations**: Works in collaboration with various decentralized entities to enhance the ecosystem.

## Community and Governance

- **DAO Structure**: Operates through a decentralized autonomous organization, where decisions are made collectively by community members and stakeholders.
- **Member Involvement**: Encourages the involvement of members in voting, decision-making, and project developments.

## Related Entities

- **[[cypherbadger]]**: A dedicated member of the Ethereum community and participant in various DAOs, including API3 DAO.
- **[[concept/Ethereum]]**: As API3 DAO aligns with the goals of the Ethereum ecosystem, it leverages Ethereum's smart contract functionality for its operations.

## Notable Interests

- **[[concept/Ethereum]]**: The platform on which API3 constructs its decentralized APIs.
- **Blockchain and Decentralization**: Continuously exploring advancements in blockchain technology and decentralization to optimize dAPI functionality.
